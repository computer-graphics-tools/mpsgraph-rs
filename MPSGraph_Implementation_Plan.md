## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority
These components are essential for completing machine learning workflows, particularly training:

1. **Automatic Differentiation**: Enables gradient computation for training
2. **Loss Ops**: Critical for implementing training loss functions
3. **Optimizer Ops**: Required for training neural networks

### Medium Priority
These operations enhance the functionality for more complex models:

1. **Random Ops**: Important for model initialization and training
2. **RNN Ops**: Required for sequence modeling
3. **Control Flow Ops**: Enables more flexible graph structures
4. **Linear Algebra Ops**: Useful for more complex matrix operations
5. **Gather/Scatter Ops**: Important for index-based operations
6. **Convolution Variants**: Extends convolution capabilities
7. **Quantization Ops**: Important for model optimization
8. **Memory Ops**: Enhances memory management in complex graphs

### Low Priority
These operations add specialized functionality that may be useful for specific applications:

1. **Resize/Transform Ops**: Image manipulation
2. **Sort/TopK Ops**: Ranking operations
3. **Fourier Transform**: Signal processing
4. **Various specialized ops**: For specific use cases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: High Priority Components ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Automatic Differentiation (`gradient_ops.rs`)
2. ✅ Loss Operations (`loss_ops.rs`)
3. ✅ Optimizer Operations (`optimizer_ops.rs`)

### Phase 2: Medium Priority Components (In Progress)
1. ✅ Random Operations (`random_ops.rs`)
2. ✅ RNN Operations (`rnn_ops.rs`)
3. ✅ Control Flow Operations (`control_flow_ops.rs`)
4. ✅ Linear Algebra Operations (`linear_algebra_ops.rs`)
5. ✅ Advanced Convolution Operations
   - ✅ Transposed Convolution (`convolution_transpose_ops.rs`) 
   - ✅ Depthwise Convolution (`depthwise_convolution_ops.rs`)

### Phase 3: Low Priority Components
1. Image and Signal Processing (`resize_ops.rs`, `fourier_ops.rs`)
2. Additional Utility Operations (sorting, top-k, etc.)
3. Specialized Operations (stencil, sample grid, etc.)

## Implementation Approach

Each new module should follow the established pattern in the existing codebase:

1. Create a new Rust file for the operation category
2. Define the necessary FFI bindings to the Objective-C API
3. Implement safe Rust wrappers with proper memory management
4. Add appropriate type conversions and error handling
5. Include documentation with examples
6. Add tests to verify functionality

## Binding Pattern

For consistency, all new bindings should follow this pattern:

```rust
pub struct MPSGraphSomeOp {
    // Raw pointer to Objective-C object
    pub ptr: ObjcPointer,
}

impl MPSGraphSomeOp {
    // Constructors with appropriate retain calls
    
    // Method wrappers using objc_rs to call Objective-C methods
    
    // Helper methods for Rust-friendly usage
}

impl Drop for MPSGraphSomeOp {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            // Proper release of Objective-C object
        }
    }
}

// Implement Send and Sync if appropriate
unsafe impl Send for MPSGraphSomeOp {}
unsafe impl Sync for MPSGraphSomeOp {}
```

## Example Implementation: Automatic Differentiation

For the highest priority missing component, here's an outline of what the implementation would look like:

```rust
// src/gradient_ops.rs

use crate::core::*;
use crate::graph::MPSGraph;
use crate::tensor::MPSGraphTensor;
use crate::operation::MPSGraphOperation;
use objc::runtime::{Object, NO, YES};
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::ffi::c_void;

impl MPSGraph {
    /// Calculates a partial derivative of primary_tensor with respect to the tensors.
    ///
    /// Returns a dictionary containing partial derivative d(primary_tensor)/d(secondary_tensor) for each tensor.
    pub fn gradient_for_primary_tensor(
        &self,
        primary_tensor: &MPSGraphTensor,
        tensors: &[MPSGraphTensor],
        name: Option<&str>
    ) -> HashMap<MPSGraphTensor, MPSGraphTensor> {
        // Implementation with proper Objective-C interop
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

The current implementation of `mpsgraph-rs` provides a solid foundation for using MPSGraph in Rust, covering all the core functionality and basic operations. By implementing the missing components according to this plan, the library can be expanded to support more advanced use cases, particularly complete training workflows for neural networks.

Priority should be given to components that enable gradient-based training, as these are typically the most requested features for machine learning frameworks.
