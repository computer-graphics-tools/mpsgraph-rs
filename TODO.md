# Objective-C to Rust API Mapping Status

The mpsgraph-rs project has successfully implemented almost all features of the Metal Performance Shaders Graph framework in Rust. Here's a summary of what has been achieved:

1. ✅ All operation types (43 headers) have been implemented with proper Rust wrappers
2. ✅ Comprehensive memory management with proper objc_retain/objc_release
3. ✅ Advanced API features like:
   - ✅ Type system enhancements with MPSGraphType and MPSGraphShapedType
   - ✅ Tensor data capabilities with rowBytes parameter and MPSImageBatch support
   - ✅ Executable serialization and specialized execution
   - ✅ Callback functionality (simulated approach)
   - ✅ Event-based synchronization with MTLSharedEvent
   - ✅ CoreML Model Package Support for loading executables from CoreML models (iOS 18/macOS 15)
   - ✅ Advanced synchronization methods with region control options

## Remaining Enhancements

1. **Testing and Examples**:
   - Add unit tests for all major functionality
   - Create more comprehensive examples:
     - Image processing examples (convolution, pooling)
     - Neural network forward and backward pass
     - Tensor manipulation operations
     - Integration with Metal shaders for custom operations
   - Add benchmarking utilities to compare performance

2. **Documentation**:
   - Add comprehensive rustdoc documentation with examples
   - Create a user guide with common patterns and best practices
   - Document version compatibility with different versions of macOS/iOS

## Optional Enhancements

1. **True Objective-C Block Support**:
   - Implement proper Objective-C block support using a compatible FFI approach
   - This would enable fully asynchronous execution with proper callbacks
   - Current implementation uses a simulated approach that works for most use cases

Note: These enhancements are optional and not required for basic functionality. The current implementation covers all essential features needed for typical use cases of MPSGraph.
