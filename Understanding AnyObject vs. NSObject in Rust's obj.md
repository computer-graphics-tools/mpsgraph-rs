# Understanding AnyObject vs. NSObject in Rust's objc2 Crate

The distinction between `AnyObject` and `NSObject` in Rust's `objc2` crate mirrors their relationship in Objective-C but with important Rust-specific considerations. This report examines their differences, implementation details, and usage patterns when bridging Rust and Objective-C code.

## Core Conceptual Differences

`AnyObject` and `NSObject` represent fundamentally different levels of abstraction in the Objective-C object model, which the `objc2` crate faithfully preserves in Rust.

### AnyObject: The Universal Type

`AnyObject` in the `objc2` crate is Rust's representation of Objective-C's `id` type - a dynamically typed reference to any Objective-C object[^2]. It serves as the most general type in the Objective-C runtime system when exposed to Rust.

```rust
// AnyObject can represent any Objective-C object instance
let object: &amp;AnyObject = /* some Objective-C object */;
```

Key characteristics of `AnyObject` include:

1. It represents any class instance in the Objective-C runtime
2. It was previously named `Object` in earlier versions of the crate (now deprecated)[^3]
3. It provides minimal compile-time type safety but maximum flexibility

### NSObject: The Base Class

`NSObject`, by contrast, represents the concrete base class from which most Objective-C classes inherit[^2]. In `objc2`, it provides both the type and the implementation details of this foundation class.

```rust
// NSObject is a specific type with known methods and properties
let object: &amp;NSObject = /* instance of NSObject or subclass */;
```

The `NSObject` type in `objc2` encapsulates:

1. The standard methods and properties of the Objective-C `NSObject` class
2. Type information that enables more specific compile-time checks
3. The foundation for creating custom Objective-C classes in Rust[^1]

## Type Hierarchy and Relationship

The relationship between these types follows a clear hierarchy that reflects their Objective-C origins:

### Every NSObject is an AnyObject

In the `objc2` crate, every `NSObject` can be treated as an `AnyObject` - mirroring the Objective-C/Swift relationship where every `NSObject` is an `id`/`AnyObject`[^2]. This means you can always use an `NSObject` where an `AnyObject` is expected.

### Not Every AnyObject is an NSObject

The reverse is not true - an `AnyObject` might represent an instance of a class that doesn't inherit from `NSObject`[^4]. While rare in practice (since most Objective-C classes do extend `NSObject`), this distinction is important for correctness and safety in the Rust bindings.

## Implementation in objc2

The implementation of these types in the `objc2` crate provides insight into their use cases and limitations.

### AnyObject Implementation

In the `objc2` crate, `AnyObject` is implemented as a low-level representation of any Objective-C object. The crate previously used the name `Object` for this concept, but it has been renamed to `AnyObject` to better align with Swift terminology[^3].

The type provides fundamental operations that any Objective-C object can respond to:

```rust
// Sending a message to any Objective-C object
unsafe { msg_send![object, someSelector] }
```


### NSObject Implementation

The `NSObject` implementation in `objc2` provides more specific functionality, including standard methods like:

- `hash_code()` - corresponding to Objective-C's `-hash`
- `is_equal()` - corresponding to Objective-C's `-isEqual:`
- `description()` - corresponding to Objective-C's `-description`
- `is_kind_of()` - corresponding to Objective-C's `-isKindOfClass:`[^8]

Additionally, it implements Rust traits like `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Debug`, and `Hash` to provide more idiomatic Rust usage[^8].

## Usage Patterns and Best Practices

When developing with `objc2`, choosing between `AnyObject` and `NSObject` depends on your specific requirements.

### When to Use AnyObject

Use `AnyObject` when:

1. You need to interact with Objective-C APIs that accept or return the generic `id` type
2. You're dealing with objects whose concrete class isn't known at compile time
3. You're implementing runtime type checking and dynamic dispatch patterns
```rust
fn process_any_object(obj: &amp;AnyObject) {
    // Work with an object of unknown concrete type
}
```


### When to Use NSObject

Use `NSObject` when:

1. You're creating custom Objective-C classes in Rust
2. You need access to standard `NSObject` methods and properties
3. You're working specifically with Foundation framework types
```rust
// Creating a custom class that inherits from NSObject
define_class!(
    #[unsafe(super = NSObject)]
    #[thread_kind = MainThreadOnly]
    #[name = "CustomClass"]
    struct CustomClass;
    
    // SAFETY: `NSObjectProtocol` has no safety requirements.
    unsafe impl NSObjectProtocol for CustomClass {}
    
    // Implementation methods...
);
```

In the example from the search results[^1], we see that when defining a new class, `NSObject` is often used as the superclass because it doesn't have any subclassing requirements.

## Protocol Considerations

An important nuance in the Objective-C world is the distinction between the `NSObject` class and the `NSObjectProtocol` protocol. In Swift, there's been a move to eliminate `NSObjectProtocol` entirely, replacing it with `AnyObject`[^9].

The `objc2` crate handles this by:

1. Providing an `NSObjectProtocol` trait that can be implemented by Rust types
2. Automatically implementing this trait for types that inherit from `NSObject`
3. Using this protocol to ensure conformance to basic Objective-C object behaviors
```rust
// As seen in the example
unsafe impl NSObjectProtocol for CustomClass {}
```


## Conclusion

In the `objc2` crate, the distinction between `AnyObject` and `NSObject` mirrors their relationship in Objective-C but adapts it to Rust's type system:

- `AnyObject` represents any Objective-C object instance (equivalent to `id`)
- `NSObject` represents the concrete base class and its known behavior
- Every `NSObject` is an `AnyObject`, but not vice versa
- The choice between them depends on your needs for type safety versus flexibility

When developing with `objc2`, it's generally better to use the most specific type possible (like `NSObject` or its subclasses from framework crates) rather than the generic `AnyObject` type, unless you specifically need the dynamic flexibility that `AnyObject` provides[^3].
